There are a lot of families here to skate tonight, yet no one is here. Website says one time, sign on office says another. Oh, did I mention the flier in the lobby says another No times on their voicemail either. Disappointing. This is our second time here today. No one mentioned there was no public skating tonight. They said they WOULD be open.




Consistently excellent.  I enjoy their sushi and know when I get a chicken dish I don't have to guess if it is eatable always good white meat.   I typically do take out and it is well worth the drive.




The food was absolutely delicious - some of the best I've ever had. However, the service was terribly slow and the waiter was quite rude. Amazing flavors but disappointing experience overall.



I went to Cobblestone for the first time today and was beyond impressed! I recently moved to Tempe and stopped getting my gel manicures because I am so picky and particular that I just didn't want to deal with finding a new place. The one day it rains in AZ I decided to give them a shot. SO glad I did as I have a new place and new technician I plan to religiously visit every 2 weeks!



The staff sucks beyond rude. Shouldn't be in business. Don't know how to make drinks. Don't waste your time or money going to this place. The nut job lady in the morning needs to be on meds.
